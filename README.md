# Learning during the studies

This repo shows things I have done and learned during my studies at Trier and Heidelberg University. <br/>
It is not everything, but a lot of the more interesting stuff regarding coding, papers and presentations.

The number in the folder name refers to the semester, the folder itself to a subject. <br/>
Everything is made by me except when stated otherwise (working in groups).
