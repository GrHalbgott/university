# Learning during the master's 

This repo shows things I have done and learned during my master's at Heidelberg University. <br/>
It is not everything, but a lot of the more interesting stuff.

The number in the folder name refers to the semester, the folder itself to a subject. <br/>
Everything is made by me except some IPI (due to highly mathematical tasks) and when stated otherwise.
