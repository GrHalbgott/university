# Learning during the master's 

This repo shows things I have done and learned during my master's at Heidelberg University. <br/>
It is not everything, but a lot of the more interesting stuff regarding coding and papers.

The number in the folder name refers to the semester, the folder itself to a subject. <br/>
Everything is made by me except when stated otherwise (working in groups), although some of the practical informatics code (C++) is by my group members during the seminar due to highly mathematical tasks (I sometimes just provided general code structure and commenting).
