## Forms and Definitions of Visual Impairment

Cataracts include many conditions, each with unique visual challenges. At the milder end of this spectrum, individuals may have partial vision. This means that even if they can see, their vision deteriorates, often leading to issues such as blurred vision or difficulty seeing fine details These complications are often caused by conditions such as glaucoma, blood loss, or mistakes which causes visual acuity which affects the focusing of the eyes.

As we move along this path, we encounter individuals who are visually impaired. They struggle with highly reflective lenses, making tasks like reading conventional print or recognizing faces more difficult. This serious problem is due to progressive visual deterioration, where objects appear less clear and contrast decreases

At the opposite end of the spectrum, we find individuals consumed by total blindness. For these individuals, visual information is severely reduced or absent, thus requiring reliance on alternative sensory modalities such as touch and hearing for pointing and information gathering tip

In addition to these basic categories, there is a special category called color blindness. Color blind people have difficulty perceiving certain colors accurately. The most common are yellow-green and blue-color blindness, affecting the ability to distinguish between these two contrasting colors.

Understanding this broad spectrum of visual impairment is critical to the development of mapping solutions that meet the needs of individuals with low vision. By considering these situations, we can create maps that are accessible and user-friendly

## Guidelines and Legal Requirements for Websites

Ensuring accessibility on the web is a major concern, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) plays a key role in this effort. The W3C published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), a comprehensive set of standards that provide a road map for making online content accessible This guideline emphasizes basic principles:

WCAG emphasizes the importance of things like font size, contrast, and distinguishability. These features are essential to make content appealing and readable, benefiting not only visually impaired individuals but also broader audiences

Access extends beyond tangibles. It also includes performance, including keyboard access and compatibility with supporting technology. Ensuring that web interactions can be made through a keyboard and compatible with screen readers and other supporting devices creates an inclusive digital environment

Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA): Developed by the W3C, ARIA provides a framework for increasing the accessibility of web applications. It allows developers to add semantic information to web content, making it more meaningful and portable for assistive technology. ARIA is especially valuable in communicating maps and ensuring they are accessible to visually impaired individuals.

The key principle of accessibility is a user-centered approach to design. Individuals with disabilities actively participate in this design and testing process. By engaging directly with the visually impaired, designers gain insight into their unique needs and preferences, resulting in more effective and inclusive mapping
## Adjustments of Virtual Maps for Visual Impairment

Crafting maps that transcend visual barriers is a multifaceted endeavor, requiring the deployment of various innovative techniques and formats.

- **Diverse Map Formats**: Maps can take on different dimensions to accommodate the needs of individuals with visual impairments. Tactile maps, 3D maps, and virtual acoustic maps offer alternative ways to convey spatial information, enabling greater accessibility.

- **Individual Map Elements**: Beyond the overarching map format, attention to detail is paramount. Lines, markers, basemaps, and other elements demand careful adjustment and evaluation to ensure effective communication of spatial information.

- elements(elements, precision and rendering style) + variables (completeness, readability ...)

- **Lack of Benchmarks**: Notably, there is a lack of standardized benchmarks for cartographic elements within accessible maps. This void underscores the imperative for ongoing research and development in this area.

## Adjustments of Routing: Changeable Elements of a Virtual Routing Representation

Navigational assistance holds immense potential for individuals with visual impairments. Adapting routing systems to address their unique needs is an ongoing area of exploration.

## Spatial cognitive and Wayfinding strategies (nur evtl weiß nicht wie hilfreich das ist)

## Examples for Specialized Use Cases

Collecting real-world examples from academic papers and websites provides insights into specialized applications that cater to the needs of individuals with visual impairments. These examples include proactive route planning and environmental learning, showcasing the practical impact of cartographic accessibility.

## Research Design and Research Gap

A notable gap exists in the realm of cartographic accessibility, with a lack of established guidelines and best practices tailored specifically to individuals with visual impairments.

- **Objective**: This study aims to bridge this gap by developing a comprehensive set of best practices for adapting map services to cater to the unique requirements of individuals with visual impairments.

- **Methodology**: To accomplish this, we have chosen to conduct interviews with experts in the fields of visual impairment, cartography, and design. This approach ensures that the insights gathered are well-informed and directly address the challenges faced by individuals with visual impairments.
